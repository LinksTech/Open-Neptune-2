# Open-Neptune 2 MKS Robin 1.2 Beta 

# *****Warning*****

I am not held liable for any issues that may arise in this build and can only say that it's worked for me. No warranty is
expressed or given.

If you're converting a stock Elegoo Neptune 2 you must realize that this will most likely void your warranty 
from Elegoo so be warned that there may be no going back.

# **To Do List:**
 * UI Cleanup 
 * Filament Autoload FIX
 * Maybe more fixes to come :D
#



## Features:

 * 4-Point Leveling-Assistant "Easy Leveling"
 * Mesh bed calibration / Auto calibration with BL-Touch
 * "Linear Pressure Control v1.5" 
 * Baby stepping during the printing process
 * Bilinear Bed Leveling (BL-Touch Version Only)
 * Pause & filament change function
 * Automatic EEPROM initialization
 * Filament runout sensor can be temporarily deactivated in the menu
 * Automatic 'slowdown' if data does not flow fast enough
 * Fully Automatic PID tuning
 * Bed Leveling Wizard  ( BL-Touch Verison Only)

The firmware is stable and works great. I've enabled every feature I could think possible and included a Wiring guide for the Bl Touch and a cheat sheet for 
editing the firmware for your personal needs. 

Have fun and happy printing!
