# Open-Neptune 2
# MKS Robin 1.2 Beta 

# *****Warning*****

I am not held liable for any issues that may arise in this build and can only say that it's worked for me. No warranty is
expressed or given.

If you're converting a stock Elegoo Neptune 2 you must realize that this will most likely void your warranty 
from Elegoo so be warned that there may be no going back.



The firmware is stable and works great. I've enabled every feature I could think possible and included a Wiring guide for the Bl Touch and a cheat sheet for 
editing the firmware for your personal needs. 

Have fun and happy printing!
